# Sort and Search

Implementation of sort and search algorithms in a that allows each file to be run both as a script or as a module. 

## How to use

A startup.py script is provided in order to run them all at once, printing their respective timing for comparison sake.

python startup.py

if you wish to run each module separetely(as a script) all you gotta do is run it letting python know that it's a module inside a package.

i.e. 

python -m sort_algorithms.heap_sort.py

Some of those scripts even have some customized output in order to make the process executed as clear as possible.

## Motivation

I created this rep because I didn't gave enough attention to those basics concepts back in university. Studying algorithms and data structures in order to become a better developer led me to implement all of these again, and so I decided to share.
